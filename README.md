# Welcome

This is a starting point for me to learn TypeScript and developing VS Code Extensions.

This first extension is based loosely on [AndrewMoll/VSCode-Weather-Extension](https://github.com/AndrewMoll/VSCode-Weather-Extension). A few exceptions being that extension is no longer maintained (it seems) my extension uses [CICCIOSGAMINO/openweather-apis](https://github.com/CICCIOSGAMINO/openweather-apis) module to make coding simplier. It also supports providing a more visual icon for the weather.

The Weather is pulled using [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current).
